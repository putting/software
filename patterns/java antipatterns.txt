superfast code can't help you when you allocate too much memory.

String concatenation
Lost StringBuffer performance
Testing for string equality
Converting numbers to Strings
Not taking advantage of immutable objects
XML parsers are for sissies
Assembling XML with String operations
The XML encoding trap
char is not int
Platform dependent filenames
Undefined encoding
Unbuffered streams
Unbuffered writes to an OutputStreamWriter
Infinite heap
Infinite time
Assuming a cheap timer call
Catch all: I don't know the right runtime exception
Exceptions are annoying
Re-wrapping RuntimeException
Not properly propagating the exception
Catching to log
Incomplete exception handling
The exception that never happens
The transient trap
Overkill initialization
Log instances: static or not?
Chosing the wrong class loader
Poor use of reflection
Synchronization overkill
Wrong list type
The HashMap size trap
Hashtable, HashMap and HashSet are overrated
Lists are overrated
Object arrays are soooo flexible
Premature object decomposition
Modifying setters
Unnecessary Calendar
Relying on the default TimeZone
Time zone "conversion"
Using Calendar.getInstance()
Dangerous Calendar manipulation
Calling Date.setTime()
Assuming SimpleDateFormat was thread-safe
Having a global Configuration/Parameters/Constants class
Not noticing overflows
Using == with float or double
Storing money in floating point variables
Not freeing resources in a finally block
Abusing finalize()
Involuntarily resetting Thread.interrupted
Spawning thread from static initializers
Canceled timer tasks that keep state
Holding strong references to ClassLoaders and unflushable caches
