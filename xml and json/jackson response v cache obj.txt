Response: goes to UI. Is a mutable (for Jackson) requires setters etc.. for serialization

 

GetDashboardDataResponse implements CachedResponse {

 

private List<Map<String, Object>> dashboardData;

private String lastUpdated;

private long checksum;

………..

 

The cache value which has the same data as response but is immutable

public class DashboardCacheValue implements CacheValue {

 

    private final Map<String, String> workflowStatuses;

    private final long checksum;

    private final Date lastUpdated;

 

 

I questioned why the 2 sikilar classes and came down to jackson
