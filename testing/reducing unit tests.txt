require a change to the tests, your tests are too weak or incomplete.”
Tips for reducing the mass of unit tests

If the cost of maintaining and running your unit tests is too high, you can follow Coplien’s guidelines for eliminating the least valuable ones:

Remove tests that haven’t failed in a year (informative value < maintenance and running costs)
Remove tests that do not test functionality (i.e. don’t break when the code is modified)
Remove tautological tests (f.ex. .setY(5); assert x.getY() == 5)
Remove tests that cannot be tracked to business requirements and value
Get rid of unit tests that duplicate what system tests do; if they’re too expensive to run, create subunit integration tests.
