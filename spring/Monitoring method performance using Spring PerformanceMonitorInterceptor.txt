Define a service, pointcut (around the svc) and the advisor in the spring context.

The advice (ie interceptor) is what will be called when svc method called.

 

                <bean id="springMonitoredService"

                                class="com.myorg.service.springmon.MyServiceSpringImpl"/>

 

                <bean id="springMonitoringAspectInterceptor" class="org.springframework.aop.interceptor.PerformanceMonitorInterceptor">

                                <property name="loggerName"  value="com.myorg.SPRING_MONITOR"/>                       

                </bean>

                                

                <aop:config>

 

                <aop:pointcut id="springMonitoringPointcut"

                   expression="execution(* com.myorg.service..MyServiceSpringImpl.methodA(..))"/>

 

                <aop:advisor pointcut-ref="springMonitoringPointcut" 

                                                advice-ref="springMonitoringAspectInterceptor"/>      

                </aop:config>

 

Observe the use of the double period (..) notation in the specification of the class name. This is akin to the pattern com.myorg.service.*.MyServiceSpringImpl. Observe also that the pointcut is actually a bean in itself.

The definition of the aspect; which, if you recall, is a combination of the pointcut and the advice. This is contained in the element <aop:advisor>, which references both the pointcut and the advice to form an aspect.
